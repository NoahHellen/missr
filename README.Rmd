The goal of missr is to help you classify missing data as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR. It does this by providing:

- Statistical tests for MCAR and MAR:
    - `mcar()`
    - `mar()`
- Process of elimination for MNAR:
    - `mnar()`

## Installation

You can install missr from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("missr")
```

Or you can install the development version on github using remotes:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("NoahHellen/missr")
```

## Examples

- Testing for MCAR.
    - Null hypothesis is that data is MCAR; if the p-value is not significant, there is evidence the data is MCAR.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mcar(data)
```

- Testing for MAR.
    - Each null hypothesis is that data is not MAR; if each p-value is significant, there is evidence the data is MAR.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mar(data)
```

- Testing for MNAR.
    - No new tests, simply a process of elimination.

```{r eval = FALSE}
mnar(data)
```
