## Assumptions about missingness

There are three assumptions about the process by which data become missing \[1].

1. *Missing completely at random* (MCAR)
2. *Missing at random* (MAR)
3. *Missing not at random* (MNAR)

## Probabilistic interpretation

The process by which data become missing is *random*, and so missing data can be formalised from a probabilistic perspective.

## Mathematical formalism

The following formalism is taken from \[1].

Define $D = \{Y,X\}$ as the $n \times m$ data matrix consisting of $n \times m-1$ predictor ($X$) and $n \times 1$ target ($Y$) variables.

Note that some authors consider $D$ as a tuple \[2].

Also define $M$ as the $n \times m$ missingness indicator matrix. Each element is $1$ or $0$ corresponding to observed or missing values in $D$ respectively.

Finally, define $D_{obs}$ and $D_{mis}$ as the observed and missing portions of $D$. In this way, $D$ can be loosely partitioned as $D = \{D_{obs}, D_{mis}\}$.

The definitions of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR are based on the probability distribution of $M$.

  - **MCAR**
    - $P(M|D) = P(M)$
  - **MAR**
    - $P(M|D) = P(M|D_{obs})$
  - **MNAR**
    - $P(M|D) = P(M|D)$

The above is summarised informally below \[1].

| Assumption | You can predict $M$ with: |
|--------|--------|
| MCAR | - |
| MAR | $D_{obs}$ |
| MNAR | $D_{obs}$ and $D_{mis}$ |
