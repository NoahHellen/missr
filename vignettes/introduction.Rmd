## What is missing data?

Missing data is defined as "data that we intended to collect, but for one reason or another were unable to" \[1].

## The problem of missing data

Missing data represents a loss of information, and so reduces the statistical power of a study \[2].

## Why was missr created?

There is a lack of information and software on practically categorising missing data.

## How do I use missr?
